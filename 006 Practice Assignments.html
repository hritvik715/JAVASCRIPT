<p><strong> The best way of learning JavaScript is by practicing it!</strong></p><p>That's why I created an assignment for each lecture in the JavaScript Fundamentals Sections Part 1 and 2 (about 25 assignments in both sections).</p><p>The goal of these assignments is that you can immediately apply the concepts you learn in each video, <strong>by writing code on your own</strong>. This will help you a lot!</p><p>So, download the assignments PDF from this lecture, and then, after you complete each lecture, find the assignment for the video you just watched, starting right now </p><p>Happy coding! </p>
